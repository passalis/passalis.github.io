### About me

I am a **postdoctoral researcher** in the <a href="http://www.csd.auth.gr/en">Department of Informatics</a> of <a href="http://www.auth.gr/en">Aristotle University of Thessaloniki</a>, working in the <a href="https://cidl.csd.auth.gr/">Computational Intelligence and Deep Learning (CIDL) </a> group led by <a href="https://cidl.csd.auth.gr/anastasios-tefas/">Prof. Anastasios Tefas</a>. I am also **adjunct lecturer** in the <a href="http://www.fme.aegean.gr/">Department of Financial and Management Engineering</a> of <a ref="https://www.aegean.gr/">University of the Aegean</a>.


### Research Interests

My research interests lie in the broad field of deep learning (DL), ranging from representation learning and lightweight DL to robotic perception and emerging hardware architectures for accelerating DL. More specifically, my current research interests are mostly focused on the following topics:
- Lighweight Deep Learning
- Representation Learning
- Robotics Perception
- Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Timeseries Analysis
- Information-theoretic Learning
- Multimodal Information Fusion
- Photonic Neuromorphic Deep Learning
